# Characters Visualization App

This project is an Angular-based application designed to explore and visualize a network of characters and their relationships. Initially, it was built to connect to a [Baserow](https://baserow.io) instance for dynamic data fetching, but it now uses static JSON files stored in the `assets` directory for simplicity.

Live demo : [https://personnages.indexvaltorta.fr](https://personnages.indexvaltorta.fr)

## Features

- Interactive graph visualization using Vis Network.
- Explore character profiles and their relationships.
- Fully client-side application â€“ no backend required.
- Modular and extendable to connect with other backend solutions like Baserow or [NocoDB](https://www.nocodb.com).

## Usage

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/mpenchenat93/characters-relations.git

   ```
3. Run the application:
   ```bash

## Data Configuration

The application is configured to work out-of-the-box using static JSON files located in the `assets` folder. However, you can reconnect it to a backend like Baserow or NocoDB by modifying the service layer to fetch data dynamically.
